# TODO:

- finish enabling new post (need to create the form, and connect existing methods, and do the yes/no dialog)
- enable sorting
- there is a bug with comments. If you vote on the top comment, it gets removed and replaced and the end of the array. Maybe need to just order comments by timestamp and all will be well...
- README.md
